I am a PhD candidate in Electrical & Computing Engineering at [McGill University](https://www.mcgill.ca/),
under the co-supervision of Professor [Derek Nowrouzezahrai](https://cim.mcgill.ca/~derek/)
and Professor [Paul G. Kry](https://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~kry/).
I am also currently working as a intern researcher at [Ubisoft La Forge](https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/studio/laforge).

My research interest spans physics-based animation, online and offline rendering, and intersections between machine learning techniques and computer graphics methods.
